The Unibrow Principle
======
My personal design philosophy is to create projects that revitalize the curiosity and sense of wonder we often lose as we become adults. By combining a childlike sense of whimsy with intellectual topics, my goal is to inspire people to explore their own creativity, expand their knowledge, and connect to greater ideas.

Accessible
-------
Highbrow, intellectual subjects are not reserved for those with the education to fully understand it.  
Lowbrow, mass-media objects are not to be kept distant as “leisure activities.”
Unibrow projects are those that explore large ideas using unexpected, enjoyable activities. They are where highbrow and lowbrow… meet in the middle. 

Encouraging
------
Unibrow projects are not explicitly educational, but involve subjects that are open to deeper exploration. These projects neither “dumb-down” the material nor alienate the general public with complicated jargon; instead, they create a space for open-minded viewers to engage their innate intelligence while still being entertained.

Enthusiastic
------
Geekery, or being overly excited about topics that would otherwise seem boring, is to be applauded. It is the starting off point for Unibrow projects, for it inspires people to share their unusual passions using methods that pique the interests of others. In this way, newcomers feel welcomed into the community and encouraged to explore their own and others’ interests further.
